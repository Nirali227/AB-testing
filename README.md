# AB Testing
### Welcome to the AB Testing Project.
A/B testing is used to compare two or more versions of a webpage, app, or marketing element to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement, conversions, or other desired outcomes. It helps make data-driven decisions by experimenting with variations and measuring their impact on user behavior.

#### Business Objective:
* A/B testing helps businesses improve conversion rates by identifying which version of a webpage or element leads to higher user clicks, sign-ups, or purchases.
* By testing different designs, layouts, or content variations, A/B testing aims to enhance the user experience and make data-backed decisions about user preferences.
* A/B testing can validate the viability of new product features, or changes before implementing them widely, reducing the risk of investing resources in unsuccessful ideas.
* A/B testing allows businesses to tailor content or offers based on user segments, optimizing the experience for different customer groups and improving overall engagement and conversions.
